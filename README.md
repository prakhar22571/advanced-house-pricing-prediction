* **Handling Continuous Data**
   - Preprocessing and cleaning continuous numerical features for better model performance.

* **Handling Discrete Data**
   - Managing discrete features efficiently to improve interpretability.

* **Log Normalization for Skewed Data**
   - Applying logarithmic transformations to mitigate skewness in data distributions.

* **Outlier Detection**
   - Identifying and addressing outliers to enhance the modelâ€™s robustness.

* **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new features and refining existing ones to improve the prediction quality.

* **Temporal Data Handling**
   - Effectively processing date and time-related data.

* **Categorical Data Handling**
   - Encoding categorical variables through appropriate methods like one-hot encoding.

* **Feature Scaling**
   - Standardizing and normalizing features to place them on the same scale.

* **Feature Selection**
   - Identifying and selecting key features to reduce dimensionality and enhance model performance.

### Machine Learning Model:
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regressor**
   - Achieved an **R-squared score of 0.89** on the test data, indicating high prediction accuracy.

### Output Results:
* The model delivers highly accurate predictions of house prices, validated with an R-squared metric.

## Usage
1. **Setup Environment:** Ensure the required Python libraries are installed (e.g., pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, etc.).
2. **Load Data:** Import the dataset in the correct format.
3. **Execute Preprocessing:** Run scripts to handle continuous, discrete, skewed data, and outliers.
4. **Train Model:** Train the SVM Regressor with optimized hyperparameters.
5. **Evaluate Performance:** Assess performance using metrics like R-squared on the test dataset.
6. **Predict Prices:** Use the trained model to predict prices on unseen data.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a methodical approach to predicting house prices by employing advanced data preprocessing and machine learning techniques, resulting in a high-performing model with an R-squared of 0.89. Future work may involve testing other algorithms or exploring further feature engineering.
